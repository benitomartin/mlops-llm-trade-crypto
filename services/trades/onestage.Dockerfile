# Compiling Python source files to bytecode is typically desirable for
# production images as it tends to improve startup time (at the cost of increased installation time).

ENV UV_LINK_MODE=copy

# Copy and Install the project's dependencies using the lockfile and settings
# uv sync --no-install-project will install the dependencies of the project
# but not the project itself. Since the project changes frequently, but its dependencies
# are generally static, this can be a big time saver.

# Then, add the rest of the project source code into the image
